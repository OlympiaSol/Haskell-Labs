These Haskell labs comprise a series of exercises designed for the 2023 academic year at the University of Ioannina. They aim to deepen understanding of Haskell programming through hands-on tasks that emphasize the creation and manipulation of functions, leveraging Haskell's capabilities for functional programming. Students are expected to engage with higher-order functions, list manipulations, and the application of functions across data structures, fostering a practical grasp of Haskell's syntax and functional programming paradigms.
